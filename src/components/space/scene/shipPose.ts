 * The model is built nosing along +Z while `Matrix4.lookAt` produces a frame
 * that looks down -Z, so a fixed 180-degree yaw has to be folded into the
 * *target* pose. Applying it to the group after interpolation (the old
 * behaviour) fed an already-corrected quaternion back into the next frame's
 * slerp, which flipped the ship 180 degrees every frame — the visible glitch.
 *
 * Pure maths, no scene access, so it can be unit tested against a recorded
 * quaternion sequence.
